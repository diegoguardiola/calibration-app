The cost of using AWS Amplify for a React web application with a backend, MongoDB services, web hosting, email notifications, and SMS notifications can be broken down into several components. Here's a summary based on the information gathered:

1. **Backend Services:**
    
    - AWS Amplify provides backend services on a pay-as-you-go basis, and some services are offered on the AWS free tier. The services include API Gateway, AppSync, CloudFront, Cognito, and several others​[1](https://aws.amazon.com/amplify/pricing/)​.
2. **Web Hosting:**
    
    - AWS Amplify offers a free tier for hosting an app for 12 months which includes up to 1,000 build minutes per month, up to 5 GB storage on CDN per month, up to 15 GB data transfer out per month, and up to 500,000 requests per month. After the free tier expires, the pricing is as follows:
        - Build & Deploy: $0.01 per minute
        - Data Storage: $0.023 per GB per month
        - Data transfer out: $0.15 per GB served
        - Request Count (SSR): $0.30 per 1 million requests
        - Request Duration (SSR): $0.20 per hour (GB-hour)​[1](https://aws.amazon.com/amplify/pricing/)​.
3. **MongoDB Services:**
    
    - MongoDB Atlas offers a perpetual free tier and usage-based pricing starting at $9 per month for a shared instance or $60 per month for a dedicated instance. The charges are per instance hour actually running, and a flat rate for data transfer​[2](https://www.mongodb.com/mongodb-on-aws/pricing)​.
    - Alternatively, Amazon DocumentDB with MongoDB compatibility is a fully managed JSON document database that provides a cost-effective solution for managing document workloads without needing to manage infrastructure​[3](https://aws.amazon.com/documentdb/#:~:text=Amazon%20DocumentDB%20,any%20scale%20without%20managing%20infrastructure)​.
    - For serverless applications with MongoDB, pricing starts from $0.10 per million reads​[4](https://www.mongodb.com/pricing#:~:text=Atlas%20Developer%20Data%20Platform%20Enterprise,Minimal%20configuration%20required)​.
4. **Email and SMS Notifications:**
    
    - The cost for email and SMS notifications would typically be handled by AWS Simple Email Service (SES) and AWS Simple Notification Service (SNS) respectively. AWS Amplify integrates with these services for notification handling.

The exact costs would depend on the usage and the AWS region in which the services are deployed. You may also consider using AWS's Pricing Calculator to get a more detailed estimate based on your specific requirements.
